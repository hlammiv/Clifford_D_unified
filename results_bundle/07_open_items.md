# 07: Open items

## Decisions (PI): resolved 2026-10-01
- Convention: **A**.
- Cost models: **report both**, unitary (7-T gadgets) and measurement (4-T gadgets).
- Draft corrections: **tabled**. A new document will likely be built from this bundle.
- The gadgets go **into this paper**.

## Waiting on Nick (request sent 2026-10-01; first dump received 2026-10-02)
- **The first dump** (`data_new/`) had only diagonal-phase copies at f ≥ 6, i.e. one distinct approximant per θ. **Follow-up needed:** rerun `find_phase_free_special_theta_exactdiff` with a much larger `--top_n` (10–100×), so that distinct approximants fall within 1.25× of the best ε.
- **Top-K candidates per θ** (frob ≤ 1.25 × best, up to K = 100–1000). The package is `nick_request/` (`INSTRUCTIONS_for_Nick.md`, `topk_dump.patch`, also zipped as `nick_stuff.zip`).
  - At f ≥ 6 his current pools have no near-neighbours, so he needs a larger `--top_n`.
  - Size: ~40 MB for 150 θ × 7 f × K = 100.
- **Our side:** `nick_request/analyze_topk.py --k 100 --max-theta 20 --procs 8`, about half a day locally on a subsample.
- **This confirms or refutes the slope estimate** of 10.0 → ~8.3 T per log₃ at f = 12–16.

## Open research questions
- **Gadget optimality.**
  - Unitary: settled. 7 T for any number of clean ancillas (`three_ancilla/`).
  - Measurement model: 4 T, optimal with ≤2 ancillas and one adaptive round. Open: ≥3 ancillas with measurement, multi-round adaptive schemes, and catalysts beyond t = 1.
- **Which model the paper uses.** Unitary (227 T) vs measurement + feed-forward (148 T). Both are physical on a fault-tolerant machine, where measurement and feed-forward are standard. The C+D/C+R ratio is 3.4× vs 3.0× (Householder).
- **A non-trivial analytic T-count lower bound.** Mana gives ≥1; thauma or stabilizer extent are not computed.
- **A rigorous version of the shadow counting argument** (`02`): A(ε) for full unitaries and the density of solvable norm equations.
- **Factory space-time volume for qutrit T-states vs qubit T-states.** It is needed for a firm qutrit-vs-qubit statement (`05`).
- **Qutrit RUS** (tabled). It cannot break the C+D/C+R tie, but could narrow the gap to qubit RUS.
- **An approximation stage that targets low T-cost directly**, rather than filtering error-optimal candidates.

## NEW (2026-10-08): generic-θ refit needed
Nick's 25-θ fits show the special-θ headline is optimistic (~15× better ε at a given f; see `nick_fits25/README.md`).

**Ask Nick for:** generic-θ best fits at f = 12, 14, 16 (ideally ~100 uniform θ, matching Gustafson), with the ε window wide enough that every fit is confirmed. Then refit N_T, using `nick_fits25/analyze_fits25.py` as the template.
