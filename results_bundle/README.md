# Qutrit Clifford+D vs Clifford+R: results bundle (2026-10-01, headline updated 2026-10-09)

This bundle collects every result from the 2026-09-29 → 10-09 work, with the code to recompute it. **Convention A (signed, R charged) is adopted** (decision 2026-10-01, below). Convention B is shown in `01` for comparison only.

## Headline (2026-10-09): T per R_z rotation at a PRESCRIBED (generic) angle, ε = 10⁻¹⁰

**Data:**
- **C+D:** best fits at generic angles.
  - Our Householder-family search (`prescribed_best/`, `hrsa/multi_theta`), with 500 angles at levels 2–12 and 100 at level 14.
  - Nick's generic f = 8, 10, which we cross-checked.
  - The data reach ε ≈ 2×10⁻⁸.
- **"Best copy"** is the cheapest of 324 exact ±ζ-phase conjugations; all have identical ε.
- **C+R:** Gustafson et al. fits (generic angles), with each R costed in the same gadget model.

| Gadget model | **C+D best copy** | C+D as given | C+R Householder | C+R Exhaustive | C+D advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unitary (level-4 = R = 7 T) | **259** (−6.5 + 12.68·log₃) | 276 | 776 | 619 | **3.0× / 2.4×** |
| Unitary + rotation merging | **194** (−3.9 + 9.42·log₃) | 205 | 554 | 442 | **2.9× / 2.3×** |
| Measurement + Clifford feed-forward (4 T) | **171** (−4.7 + 8.39·log₃) | 181 | 444 | 354 | **2.6× / 2.1×** |

- **These replace the 10-02 special-angle headline** (206 / 154 / 136, below) for prescribed rotations.
  - Nick's special-angle matrices each choose their own best angle.
  - At a fixed level they cost the same T as generic angles (within ~3% at levels 6–12), but reach a 12–56× smaller ε (levels 8–14).
  - So the special-angle fits are ~25% optimistic at 10⁻¹⁰.
- **Per-phase count (N_D) at generic angles:** −3.6 + 6.86·log₃.
  - That is above C+R Householder's 5.14, so the old "C+D ≈ C+R per phase" tie holds only for special angles.
  - **The fault-tolerant T-cost advantage (2.1–3.0×) survives either way.**
- **Qubits, per arbitrary single-qutrit gate** (6 rotations vs ≥ 10 qubit rotations for two-qubit emulation): C+D is **1.03× (measurement) / 1.17× (merged)** the deterministic qubit cost, and 2.2–2.5× qubit RUS. Details are in `08`.
- **Search coverage:** our search is restricted to the Householder family. On Nick's 25 generic angles it ties his statistically: median ratio of our best ε to his is 0.98 and 1.00, and each search finds matrices the other misses.

## Headline (superseded for prescribed angles, 2026-10-02): special angles

C+D: Nick's exact approximants, 30 θ × 7 f-levels. "Best copy" = the cheapest of 324 exact ±ζ-phase conjugations, all with identical ε. C+R: Gustafson et al. fits, with each R costed in the same gadget model.

| Gadget model | C+D as given | **C+D best copy** | C+R Householder | C+R Exhaustive | C+D advantage (best copy) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unitary (level-4 = R = 7 T) | 223 (18.7 + 9.73·log₃) | **206** (2.5 + 9.71·log₃) | 776 (R = 7 T) | 619 | **3.8× / 3.0×** |
| Unitary + rotation merging (shared ancilla) | 166 (14.1 + 7.23·log₃) | **154** (3.3 + 7.21·log₃) | 554 (merged R = 5.0 T) | 442 | **3.6× / 2.9×** |
| Measurement + Clifford feed-forward (4 T) | 146 (10.9 + 6.44·log₃) | **136** (1.8 + 6.42·log₃) | 444 (R = 4 T) | 354 | **3.3× / 2.6×** |

- **The savings stack.**
  - Copy selection lowers the intercept by ~10–16 T per rotation in every model. The slope is unchanged.
  - Merging lowers the slope (9.7 → 7.2). The best copy for unmerged cost stays the best after merging.
  - Source: `symmetry_variants/stack_summary.txt` (68,040 decompositions; script `stack_analyze.py`).
- **Merging on the C+R side:** R chains merge to **5.0 T per R**, measured on C+R-shaped gadget chains. So the merged row compares like with like.
- **Sample size:** fits use n = 210 (30 θ per f). The as-given unitary fit (9.73·log₃, 223 at 10⁻¹⁰) agrees with the 900-matrix fit (10.0·log₃, 227).
- **Not included yet:** best-of-K over genuinely different approximants. That awaits Nick's larger `--top_n` rerun; at f = 4 it gave a further ~37%.

## Headline (original, 2026-10-01)

| | C+D (this work) | C+R (Gustafson et al. 2503.20203) |
|---|---|---|
| Per-phase gate count, convention A (R charged) | 3.94 + **5.16**·log₃(1/ε) | Householder 5.14, Exhaustive 4.11 ·log₃(1/ε) |
| Per-phase gate count, convention B (R free) | 2.94 + **4.82**·log₃(1/ε) | same |
| **Fault-tolerant T-cost per rotation** (qutrit T-factory machine) | 16.6 + **10.0**·log₃(1/ε) → **~227 T at 10⁻¹⁰** | R built from 7 T: ~776 (Householder) / ~619 (Exhaustive) at 10⁻¹⁰ → **C+D 3.4× / 2.7× cheaper** |
| **T-cost, measurement model** (level-4 = R = 4 T, both sides) | 9.7 + **6.58**·log₃(1/ε) → **~148 T at 10⁻¹⁰** | R = 4 T: ~444 / ~354 → **C+D 3.0× / 2.4× cheaper** |

- **Gadget costs:**
  - unitary model: R = level-4 = **7 T**, optimal for any number of clean ancillas;
  - measurement + Clifford feed-forward: **4 T** each, optimal within the searched classes.
- **Per-phase gate count:** the tie under A is the old "C+D ≈ C+R" result.
- **T-cost:** the robust comparison. It does not depend on the A/B choice, because the 7 R per rotation are paid in T either way.

## Decisions (PI, 2026-10-01)
1. **Counting convention: A (signed 𝒟, R ∈ C+D, R charged).** Report the per-class counts (n_T, n_4, n_R) as the primary data, with T-cost as the headline. N_φ (per-phase, R charged) is kept only for comparison with the literature. Convention B appears only to explain why the draft's numbers differ.
2. **Cost models: report both.**
   - Unitary gadgets (level-4 = R = 7 T, optimal for any number of clean ancillas): ~227 T at 10⁻¹⁰, 3.4× / 2.7× cheaper than C+R.
   - Measurement + Clifford feed-forward gadgets (4 T each): ~148 T at 10⁻¹⁰, 3.0× / 2.4× cheaper than C+R with R = 4 T.
3. **Draft corrections: tabled.** A new document will probably be written using this bundle as its base, rather than patching `ESA_CliffordD_fixed.tex`. `paper_prep/draft_corrections.md` stays as a reference list of errors not to repeat.
4. **The 7-T and 4-T gadgets go into this paper,** not a separate note.
5. **Nick:** request sent 2026-10-01; awaiting the top-K dump.
